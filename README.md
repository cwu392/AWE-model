In this paper, we follow the Theano code from https://github.com/yinwenpeng/SciTail

By using our asymmetric word embedding method, we learn interactions with "premise" and "hypothesis" directly from training set.

By adding this relationships, our method can improve both DEISTE and Decomposable Attention model on both SciTail and SNLI dataset.

In the end, we achieved current state-of-the-art accuracy on SciTail which is 84.2%. (+2.1% on DEISTE)
